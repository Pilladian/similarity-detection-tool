# Security Score

### First thoughts

- amount of servers
	- DNS -> poisoning
	- email -> 
	- website -> one down, website dead

- different top level domain
	- paypal.com
		- .de
		- .org
		- .net
		- .pay

- popular typos
	- paypal.com
		- paipal.com
		- psypal.com

- location server
	- data privacy
	- which government is in charge

- bad configuration (!pen testing)
	- ssh
	- telnet
	- sql injections

Later when combining projects:
- ads
    - is data shared with big companys like google, facebook
    
- libraries
    - how many are used -> dependent on a lot
    - outdated
